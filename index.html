This year Tesla opened a new location, their third showroom in New York City. The NYCity News Service ventured to Gowanus to find out more about the Tesla’s Cybertrucks that seem to be popping up <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/cybertruck-elon-musk-tesla-new-york-city.html">everywhere</a> around the city. </p>

<p>
At nearly 7,000 lbs, the Cybertruck is nearly two times the size of the next largest available Tesla vehicle. “It's a big truck,” which is difficult to park on the New York City streets, explained one Gowanus Tesla employee. “Most people who are driving these trucks will have a driveway or a garage–so you're looking at Staten Island, Upstate New York, Long Island, and New Jersey,” he explained, estimating that New Jersey drivers probably lead the sales he oversees. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LKFfAmGGGFfxFdVOSPLLtFSwsnPqZlCt1SBeZvAzy5g/edit?usp=sharing">Data</a> from New York City's Vehicle Registrations showed a similar story—within New York the zip codes with the most cybertrucks are some of the city's most residential neighborhoods. </p>

One such afformentioned New Jersey Cybertruck driver stood right next to Tesla salesperson. Brandon Martinez, who drives to work in Brooklyn every day from Jersey, is an energy sales brand ambassador at Con Edison who has a role to play at the Gowanus store. Martinez, who used to work at Tesla, now helps EV drivers get set up with a rebate from Con Edison to save on their electrical vehicle charging. He says that 20,000 Tesla drivers have signed up for the rebate, which rewards drivers for charging during off-peak hours, far outpacing other car manufacturers.

<p>
Martinez loves his Cybertruck and all the gadgets and features it has to offer like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iKO3NfRDjE">“steer-by-wire”</a> technology, which eliminates the mechanical connection between the wheels and the steering wheel. As long as they stay away from potholes and be mindful of the struggles of driving an electric car in the winter, he says, the $80,000 price tag is worth it. “The price you're paying is for the technology inside,” says Martinez.

He also doesn’t mind the attention. “A lot of people like taking photos with it–I’ll even take one with them,” he says with a smile. “People will bang on it, it’s a piece of metal…a lot of people like to touch the car, so it’s hard to keep clean.”
